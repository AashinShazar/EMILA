# EMILA
Electromyography Muscular Interface Limb Assist - An Investigation into Neural Prosthetics 

## Project Description
Project EMILA is a cursory investigation into neural prosthetics. 
This project essentially gathers EMG data from EMG sensors and has it interpeted by a machine learning classifier to perform a previously mapped gesture. 
Much of neural prostethics technology is still in its infancy and this project was made to learn more about this growing field and where this technology stands today. 

## Project Requirements
As this project was made for my ENGR 478 (Design with Microprocessors) class. 

A few hard requirements were stated and are as follows:
- Must use a PSOC microcontroller
- Feature real time components
- Feature multitasking events
- Host GUI
- Feature at least two interrupt routines at varying priorities
- Interaction with sensors / Some Data Acquisiotion
